# AGENTS.md

This project conforms to Bevry's skills.
Reference their remote URLs only — do not pull their contents into this file.
When a referenced skill applies with this project's tweaks, the local `<name>.md` file at this repo root references the remote URL and lists the tweaks underneath;
this process is documented in the upstream repo's [local tweaks pattern](https://github.com/bevry-vibes/skills#local-tweaks-pattern).

- https://github.com/bevry-vibes/skills/blob/main/policy.md — **applies.** Bevry's AI policy, mandating which AIs are permitted
- https://github.com/bevry-vibes/skills/blob/main/commits.md — **applies.** Commit hygiene: Conventional Commits, author vs co-author identity, verification
- https://github.com/bevry-vibes/skills/blob/main/plans.md — **applies.** Cross-harness plan conventions: plans and provenance companions in `.plans/`
- https://github.com/bevry-vibes/skills/blob/main/minimax.md — **applies** when the running agent is a MiniMax M3 model (its rules gate themselves on model and harness)

## Project

`kagi_translate.py` is a stdlib-only Python client + CLI for Kagi Translate's web endpoints (see the README's endpoint table). Keep it dependency-free. Kagi Translate has no public API; the endpoints are the web app's own and can change — the README documents the discovery date.

The session cookie is read from `KAGI_SESSION` only and must never be committed — `.env` is gitignored; check `git grep` before committing anything that touched credentials. Never commit captured tokens, JWTs, cookies, or browser traffic logs.
